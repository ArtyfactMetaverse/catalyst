Artyfact is...
Artyfact is the first Web3 Gaming Metaverse that brings together the best of AAA Gaming and GameFi by combining the latest gaming technologies and a revolutionary Play-and-Earn economic model that puts gaming experience above earnings.


Problems and solutions
Gamers make up almost 1/3 of the world’s population today, but despite the growing popularity of Gamefi, only 1% of games are GameFi. The big gap between GameFi and AAA games is due to the fact that most GameFi games use a Play-to-Earn (P2E) model that focuses more on earnings and does not pay due attention to important game aspects, such as gameplay, playability, graphics quality, mecanics, and others.
Artyfact aims to solve this problem and become the first game that will be truly interesting to the average gamer.
This will be achieved by bringing together the latest technologies and best practices from both GameFi and AAA worlds, using an innovative Play-and-Earn (PAE) model that puts gaming experience ahead of earnings.


ARTYFACT
Artyfact is the virtual world where players can find entertainment for every taste using $ARTY, the platform’s utility token. Artyfact citizens are able to play various AAA quality PAE games and earn $ARTY, buy and trade NFTs such as avatars, weapon skins, virtual estate, clothes, as well as attend virtual concerts, NFT exhibitions, runway shows and other events.
While P2E was just the first Web3 economic model to have gained traction within GameFi, this model has been perhaps far too focused on building a gamers' base, which is considered the supply side of GameFi.
However, the demand side that keeps the economy balanced hasn’t scaled fast enough.


Our mission
Our mission is to create the first metaverse game that will be truly interesting to the average gamer.
Using an innovative Play-and-Earn (PAE) model.
We will do this by combining the best of the AAA and GameFi games and creating virtual world with an innovative Play-and-Earn (PAE) model where anyone can play, earn, trade and exhibit NFTs, and just have fun. 


Our vision
Our vision is to become the top 5 GameFi games of 2023 and expand our metaverse for a decade. With Artyfact, we are aiming to disrupt the existing GameFi games like The Sandbox, Decentraland, Axie Infinity by providing gamers unique AAA level expiriences and opportunities that games based on an outdated Play-to-Earn model cannot give.
